            <h2>Blood Groups</h2>
        <p>
            There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) â€“ A, B, AB and O. Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each group can be either RhD positive or RhD negative, which means in total there are 8 blood groups.
        </p>
        <h2>Antibodies and Antigens</h2>
        <p>
            Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Antibodies are proteins found in plasma. They're part of your body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances, such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.
        </p>
        <h2>The ABO System</h2>
        <p>
            There are 4 main blood groups defined by the ABO system:

        <table class="blood-group-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Blood Group</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Blood group A</strong></td>
                    <td>Has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Blood group B</strong></td>
                    <td>Has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Blood group O</strong></td>
                    <td>Has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Blood group AB</strong></td>
                    <td>Has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p>
            Blood group O is the most common blood group. Almost half of the UK population (around 48%) has blood group O.
        </p>
        <p>
            Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            As group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.
